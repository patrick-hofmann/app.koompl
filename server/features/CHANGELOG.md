# Feature Architecture Changelog

## 2025-10-10 - Initial Feature Architecture

### Created Feature Modules

Implemented a comprehensive feature-based architecture in `/server/features/` to centralize business logic and provide reusable functionality across REST endpoints, MCP servers, and utilities.

- Already existed, serves as the pattern for other features
- Secure file vault with hierarchical organization
- Rule-based attachment placement
- Full CRUD operations for files and folders
- Statistics and analytics

#### üìã kanban.ts (New)
- Complete Kanban board management
- Board, column, and card CRUD operations
- Card movement between columns
- Search functionality across all boards
- Board statistics

#### üìÖ calendar.ts (New)
- Calendar event management
- Date range and user-specific queries
- Availability checking for scheduling
- Event search functionality
- Upcoming events retrieval
- Calendar statistics

#### ü§ñ agent.ts (New)
- AI agent lifecycle management
- Agent directory with capabilities
- Capability-based agent search
- Email/username lookups
- Inter-agent communication checks
- MCP server association
- Agent statistics

#### üîå mcp.ts (New)
- MCP server configuration management
- Provider and category filtering
- Builtin vs external server separation
- Server templates and presets
- Server health checking
- Agent execution with MCP servers
- Server statistics

#### üë• team.ts (New)
- User management
- Team management
- Membership management with roles
- Super admin management
- Team member and user team queries
- Access validation
- Team statistics

### Supporting Documentation

#### README.md
- Complete feature overview
- Architecture explanation
- Usage patterns and examples
- Context pattern documentation
- Best practices guide
- Contributing guidelines

#### EXAMPLES.md
- REST API endpoint examples
- MCP server operation examples
- Background job examples
- Cross-feature workflow examples
- Best practices and anti-patterns

#### index.ts
- Central export point for all features
- Namespace exports for organized imports
- Type exports for external usage

### Architecture Benefits

1. **Reusability**: Single source of truth for business logic
2. **Consistency**: Uniform interface across all features
3. **Testability**: Isolated, pure functions easy to test
4. **Maintainability**: Changes in one place affect all consumers
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with exported types
6. **Scalability**: Easy to add new features following the pattern

### Design Patterns

#### Context Interface
```typescript
interface FeatureContext {
  teamId: string    // Required: Team isolation
  userId?: string   // Optional: User context
  agentId?: string  // Optional: Agent context
}
```

#### Function Signatures
- Clear, descriptive names (listBoards, createEvent, etc.)
- Context as first parameter
- Additional parameters as objects for flexibility
- Typed return values or null/undefined for not found
- Throws errors for validation failures

#### Layered Architecture
```
REST/MCP/Utilities ‚Üí Features ‚Üí Storage/Utils ‚Üí Database/Storage
```

### Migration Path

Existing code can gradually migrate to use features:

**Before:**
```typescript
import { getTeamBoards } from '../../utils/kanbanStorage'
const boards = await getTeamBoards(teamId)
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { listBoards } from '../../features/kanban'
const boards = await listBoards({ teamId, userId })
```

### Statistics and Analytics

Each feature includes statistics functions:
- `getStats()` / `getBoardStats()` / `getCalendarStats()` etc.
- Provides insights into usage patterns
- Enables dashboard and reporting features

### Future Enhancements

Potential additions to the feature architecture:
- Mail/Email feature module
- Notification feature module
- Analytics feature module
- Audit log feature module
- Webhook feature module
- Search/indexing feature module

### Breaking Changes

None - this is purely additive. Existing code continues to work, and can be gradually migrated to use the new feature layer.

### Testing Recommendations

Features should be tested at multiple levels:
1. Unit tests for individual feature functions
2. Integration tests for cross-feature workflows
3. End-to-end tests for complete user flows

### Performance Considerations

- Features cache appropriately at the storage layer
- Bulk operations available where useful (e.g., getUsersEvents)
- Statistics functions may be expensive for large datasets
- Consider adding pagination for list operations in future

### Security Considerations

- All operations are team-scoped via context
- User/Agent context enables audit trails
- Permission checking should occur at the API layer
- Features assume valid, authorized context

### Documentation

- Inline JSDoc comments on all exported functions
- README with comprehensive overview
- EXAMPLES with practical usage patterns
- Type definitions exported for IDE support

### Files Created/Modified

Created:
- `/server/features/kanban.ts`
- `/server/features/calendar.ts`
- `/server/features/agent.ts`
- `/server/features/mcp.ts`
- `/server/features/team.ts`
- `/server/features/index.ts`
- `/server/features/README.md`
- `/server/features/EXAMPLES.md`
- `/server/features/CHANGELOG.md`

Already Existed:
- `/server/features/datasafe.ts` (used as pattern)

### Code Quality

- ‚úÖ Zero linting errors
- ‚úÖ Full TypeScript coverage
- ‚úÖ Consistent naming conventions
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive type exports
- ‚úÖ Clear function documentation
- ‚úÖ Error handling with meaningful messages

### Next Steps

1. Update existing API endpoints to use features
2. Update existing MCP operations to use features
3. Add unit tests for feature functions
4. Add integration tests for workflows
5. Consider adding pagination to list functions
6. Add more statistics/analytics functions as needed
7. Document migration strategy for team
